	While studying in the library, Bucky Badger started to feel quite tired. If his roommate hadn't been so loud at night, maybe he wouldn't be fending off sleep right now, the night before his Math 222 midterm. But what could he
do about it now other than buy another coffee and try his hardest. But when Bucky went to check his watch, he realized the library closed in 15 minutes. Bucky started to panic, as he wasn't sure what to do. He ran back to his table and
grabbed all of his books and notes and jammed them into his backpack and decided he would go to the his friend's apartment, who Bucky knew was quite the night owl. However, just as he started to walk down State Street, Bucky tripped on
a rock on the ground and hit his head. Next thing Bucky knew, he was blacked out on State Street the night before his midterm waiting for anyone to help him.
